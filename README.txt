== participants-widget ==

This wordpress widget displays a list of the blog's participants, with a link to their profile,
 and the number of posts and comments they have contributed.

Copy the themes/authors.php file into your theme directory you can also override the profile behavior 
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Author_Templates#Which_Template_File_is_Used.3F), and display a list of the 
author's posts, and comments (deep linked to the context they they came from).
